# HDSC_STAGE-E_Quiz
Tag-Along Jupyter Notebook file for Stage E Quiz for Hamoye Data Science Internship 2023.


## Practical Time Series Analysis & Forecast
In this quiz, we explored and buillt time series forecasting models for measurements of electricity prices 
of a District given the total amount of Electricity consumed in that District from 2010 to 2021.

## Data Set Information:

The archive contains 92,016 measurements of electricity data gathered between September 2010 and February 2021.

### Notes:

The dataset is sampled on an hourly basis. It has the following features:

#### Attribute Information:

1) FullDate: Date in format yyyy-mm-dd  hh:mm:ss
2) ElecPrice: Prices of electricity charged in Kw per hour
3) Gas Price: power generated was done via a gas power plant, gas price is the price of gas at time-T
4) SysLoad: Total Load on system or Power consumed at time-T
5) Tmax: maximum temperature at time-T
